Today we welcome a new doodle to the pack - Moose!  After several weeks of talking about it, we've decided to become guardians for this chill dude.  

Since my wife works part-time with the breeder (a very cool side hustle for her to learn about the dogs), we've had the opportunity to puppy-sit from time to time over the last year.   Moose came for a visit, 'just a few days'.   I'm convinced it was a ploy to get me to bond with the puppy and say yes to letting him stay with us...
