Oodles of doodles is our attempt to document our adventures and experiences with our two austrailian labradoodles.  We're pretty sure an 'oodle' is way more than two, but its our hope to expand our knowledge of these super smart pups and encourage others to consider the mixed-breed as well.

*We are by no means experts* Like parenting, a lot of what we learn is by trial and error, some laughable calls to the vet for advice, and some intense searching through internet groups.  Please do not use this blog for medical advice, except that if you're in doubt, call your vet - you know your own pet better than anyone else.

Who are our doodles?   We have two mini austrailian labradoodles (and one cat who thinks shes a dog).  Our other two doodles are really humans, but they are nearly grown, so we've given up teaching them how to sit and stay, though they will do the laundry if asked. ;)

Madison is our cat.  She's the matriarch of the pack at ~10yr old.  A part feral rescue, who thinks shes a dog and understands simple commands like sit, she tolerates the dogs.   As long as they don't get in her way, she stays out of theres - unless theres chicken on the menu, then she bellies up to the table with the pups. :)

Piper is the oldest doodle.  A 2 1/2 year old ~18lb-ish female, spayed, with Addison's disease.  She's super smart - we've considered trying that trick with the buttons that can be pressed easily to say words, but we're kinda afraid what she would say to us. Even without that medium, she expressively lets us know what she wants in almost all occasions.   There's nothing better than coming home and having her greet you at the door with her tail spinning like a cyclone.

Moose is our latest pack member.  At 4 months old, he's already mastered sit, kennel up, hop up, and down.  We're working on stay and high-five, but honestly, he's all about the food.  Where Piper is high strung (likely due to the addisons), Moose is super chill unless its play time... he's taller than Piper already and in her weight class, so its an even play match for the moment.   Oh, he's also a breeding dog - we're his guardians and can officially adopt him when he's retired -- thats sure to provide some interesting posts as he matures.
